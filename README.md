# FM3 Buddha Machine

The Buddha Machine fulfills certain criteria of a generative music device. In 2005,
[FM3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM3) began work on a small musical loop player they
called the Buddha Machine, inspired by similar devices often sold at Buddhist temples
in East Asia.

Roughly the size of a pack of cigarettes, the device features a single toggle switch to cycle
through samples, a combined power and dial, and an integrated speaker. The device contains a chip
holding nine digitally-encoded drones, ranging in length from 1.5 to 40 seconds. The name and idea
is derived from a popular Chinese device that intones repeating loops of Buddhist chanting.

As the devices are increasingly difficult to get, this demo simulates having multiple able to
play simultaneously.

## What does it do?

* Simulates having multiple Buddha Machines.
* Supports Left audio channel.
* Supports Right audio channel.
* Supports both audio channels (Stereo)

## Dependencies

* Flash :(

## How to use it

Begin by clicking a player icon. Each Buddha Machine can play 9 different loops.

Buddha Machines towards the left will play on the left audio channel, towards the
right will play on the right audio channel. Those in the center play on both channels.

Each loop loops at slightly different intervals. Try playing the same loops, try
different loops. Experiment.
